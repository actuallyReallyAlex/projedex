## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I'm plagued by a problem that tons of other developers have as well - _side-project-itis_. All the time I feel like I have a good idea for a new project, and pop open a new GitHub repo with a little bit of starter code. Maybe I work on it for a day or so, then I have to refocus on my main priorities. A week goes by and wouldn't you know it, I just had another good idea for a new project.

With all these extra ideas lying around, simply looking at your GitHub repos and trying to remember exactly where you were in the process on each one isn't so easy. That's why I made **Proj√©dex**.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Import repositories as projects from GitHub inside Projedex. Manage your ideas as visible, maintainable projects.
